Under the new administration, knowing our rights is now more important than ever. And it starts with education.

Students across the country struggle to know the basics of their government and their rights as some curricula fail to teach and students fail to practice their knowledge. 

Introducing Law by AI, an accessible and engaging technology for people of all ages and backgrounds to exercise their knowledge of law every day.

There are two versions of Law by AI. The Daily Puzzle’s concept is similar to the popular game “Wordle,” where users respond to the same AI-generated scenario and try to reach a good ending. The AI scores them and allows users to share their responses, which can be available for public viewing on the leaderboard to give people other ways to handle the situations. Free Play serves as the practice ground for the Daily Puzzle, where users can respond to multiple new scenarios and familiarize themselves with the technology.

Law by AI focuses on educating its users first and foremost, adhering to the UN’s 4th and 10th goals: Quality Education and Reduced Inequalities. Law by AI supports all of its generated responses with an existing federal law, helping the user learn the law. We realized that everyone has different ways of playing, and with open-ended user responses, we needed to consider how this technology could be used. So, we demoed Law by AI with a diverse population of users, including our peers and mentors, which helped us land our final rubric, which has three categories: Knowledge: the user’s general knowledge of what is legal or illegal; Application: how well the user responds to the AI’s corrections; and Process: how many turns it takes the user to reach a good ending.
